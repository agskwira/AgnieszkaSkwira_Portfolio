## About me

I am a professional team member and leader experienced in modern measurement techniques. In my work, I faced QC and QA tasks. I also worked closely with developers in order to adjust the software to the team and organization’s needs. I love constant development and I easily adapt to new situations. I love working with software and Improving it. That's why I decided to change my career path.  I’m open to new testing challenges, and in the future, I would like to develop myself in the field of test automation.
